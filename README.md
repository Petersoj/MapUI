# MapUI
A library for creating intuitive GUIs in Minecraft using Maps and their rasters.

### Future To Do
- Allow a player to move (WASD) to exit the MapUI (include API)
- Client Side Peripheral Block ArmorStand (use ProtocolLib to listen for PlayerInteractEntity packet)
- Scrolling Input (scrolls in hotbar, but MapUI responds and cancels hotbar scrolling)
- Ability for text input (using chat or Anvil GUI)
